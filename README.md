This repo contains all of the code to complete the freeCodeCamp course, "Build a Semantic Book Recommender with LLMs â€“ Full Course". There are five components to this tutorial:

Text data cleaning (code in the notebook data-exploration.ipynb)
Semantic (vector) search and how to build a vector database (code in the notebook vector-search.ipynb). This allows users to find the most similar books to a natural language query (e.g., "a book about a person seeking revenge").
Doing text classification using zero-shot classification in LLMs (code in the notebook text-classification.ipynb). This allows us to classify the books as "fiction" or "non-fiction", creating a facet that users can filter the books on.
